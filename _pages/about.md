I am a PhD student at Imperial College London specialising in numerical modelling of natural environmental systems. My research combines advanced computational methods with civil engineering principles to simulate and analyze complex environmental processes. I work extensively with numerical modeling frameworks across multiple programming languages including MATLAB, Python, Fortran, and Julia, developing robust simulations that help us better understand how natural systems respond to various conditions and changes. With a Master's degree in Civil Engineering as my foundation, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical environmental science and practical computational solutions that can inform real-world decision-making.
