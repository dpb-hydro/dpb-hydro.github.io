My doctoral research focuses on developing and implementing advanced numerical models to simulate complex processes in natural environmental systems. I employ a multi-language computational approach, leveraging the strengths of MATLAB, Python, Fortran, and Julia. My work involves creating robust computational models that can accurately capture the intricate interactions between physical, chemical, and biological processes in environmental systems. Through this, I aim to provide quantitative insights that bridge fundamental environmental science with practical engineering applications, particularly in areas where traditional analytical solutions are insufficient for capturing the full complexity of natural phenomena.
