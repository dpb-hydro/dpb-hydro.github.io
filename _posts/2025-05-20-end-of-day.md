Well it's the end of a long day which was the first day that I have had my website. I have been consolidating old notes on papers into my thesis document. It's extremely messy at the moment but it is nice to finally have everything in one document. Hopefully that will now gradually be able to tend to something more coherent. It was nice to see that I have actually gotten through a lot in the last few months, certainly more than I felt that I did at HKU. I just need to be sure to be able to write about and clearly explain all of it as it is easy to miss stuff that I haven't reviewed in a long time. 

Tomorrow I have volunteered to give a presentation at the group meeting. It wasn't mandatory but I figured it would be a good first attempt at my ESA presentation; it would be nice to feel like it was ready to go this far in advance of the deadline. Tomorrow I also want to make sure I read the Jha paper as well as look through the new meta analysis github. I also wonder if my data is going to become available this week.

I'd better go to bed. See you tomorrow!
