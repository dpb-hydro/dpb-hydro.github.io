Earlier today was my slot for speaking at our group meeting at university. I used the slot to give the first version of my ESA presentation which will be taking place in a few weeks' time. I think it went quite well, but for the final version I think I might need to include a little more detail and length. I got some useful feedback from the group. One point was to specify which scenarios I will be looking at in WP3, or possibly which sources I will look towards for that. They mentioned that IPCC is bringing out some new scenarios which might be useful to mention. Another point was that maybe it's best not to approach the motivation from yield only; i.e. how will biodiversity be incoprporated? There was also the point that it relates to building with nature and the idea of tradeoffs between KPIs. Perhaps also was the idea of which possible edits I anticipate making to the code. Finally it looked like people were struggling to see the RA definition slide so might want to make that bigger.
