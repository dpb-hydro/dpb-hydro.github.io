Just returned from an incredible week in Cyprus on a workshop for my PhD project. Between early morning presentations and code tweaks, I managed to explore some of Nicosia and sample the local cuisine. The combination of productive research work and experiencing a new environment has given me fresh perspectives on my modeling approaches, and I'm excited to take this forward into my ongoing simulations. There's something invaluable about getting out of the office and seeing firsthand the complex natural systems we're trying to capture computationally.
