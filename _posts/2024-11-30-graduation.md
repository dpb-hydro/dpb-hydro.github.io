What an incredible journey it's been! After two years of intensive research and study, I've officially completed my MPhil at HKUST. The final weeks were a whirlwind of thesis submissions, presentations, and that unmistakable mix of exhaustion and exhilaration that comes with reaching a major milestone.

The best part of finishing? Finally having the time to properly show my family around this amazing city that's been my home for the past six years. We spent days exploring everything from the bustling streets of Central to the serene Lamma Island. Watching them experience Hong Kong through fresh eyes reminded me of my own first impressions – the incredible energy, the stunning harbor views, and of course, the food. We ate our way through the trip indulged in everything from street food to sea food. Each meal was a reminder of why Hong Kong captured my heart so completely – it's not just the incredible diversity of flavors, but the way food brings people together here, creating moments of connection amidst the city's constant motion.

As I prepare for the next chapter of my academic journey, I'm carrying with me not just the research skills and knowledge I've gained, but also a deep appreciation for this remarkable place that challenged me, inspired me, and fed me so well – both intellectually and literally. Hong Kong, you'll always hold a special place in my heart. Here's to new beginnings and the memories that make them possible!
